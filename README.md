# Informative Path Planning (IPP) tools

This is intended to be a generic library for widely used methods in Informative Path Planning or Active Perception in robotics. It is designed with IPP and AP in mind but it can potentially be used for simple path planning.

The structure is intented to be agnostic to the configuration space with particular definitions for 2D and 3D.

## Integration with your code

Right now, this is plain code that has to be manually integrated. In the future a proper library will be built around it.
